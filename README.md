# Team Task Manager

A full-stack collaborative task management application built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- **User Authentication** - Signup/Login with JWT-based auth
- **Project Management** - Create projects, add/remove team members
- **Task Management** - Create, assign, and track tasks with status, priority, and due dates
- **Dashboard** - Overview of tasks by status, overdue tasks, and per-user breakdown
- **Role-Based Access** - Admin (full control) and Member (view/update assigned tasks)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Create server/.env
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
```

> The first user who signs up is automatically assigned the Admin role.

### Development

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev:client
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`, backend on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build   # Builds frontend
npm start       # Starts server (serves frontend from dist/)
```

## Deployment (Railway)

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Create a new project on [Railway](https://railway.app)
3. Add a MongoDB service (or use MongoDB Atlas)
4. Add your backend service from GitHub
5. Set environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - A secure random string
   - `PORT` - Railway assigns this automatically
6. Set build command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ../server && npm install`
7. Set start command: `cd server && npm start`
